Some remarks on conformance to specification outside of those in the paper
on the differing meaning of the in-window relation for different implementations.

Linux (BASE+ACK model)
We notice that once in the FIN_WAIT2 state 
(after the FIN from CLOSE has been ack.-ed), all resets with seq. num.
in window reset the connection. 

This is a slight deviation from RFC 5961, which specifies that for all synch.
states only resets with the seq. num. equal to  the expected sequence number, 
should reset the connection. (this is the case for all synch. states 
other than FIN_WAIT2) 

Another thing we notice is that whilst the sequence number acceptability test is properly
implemented, with an empty ACK segment being issued whenever the received sequence
number is unacceptable(not within window), the ack. number acceptability test is not. An unacceptable
acknowledgement number should also prompt generation of a similar ACK segment. Linux stays silent
of receipt of a segment with valid seq. num. but unacceptable ack. num., breaking RFC 793 (see page 37).
This is the same non-conformance as that noted in the first application of automata learning to TCP.
