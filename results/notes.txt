In the Linux +ACK model, we notice that once in the FIN_WAIT2 state 
(after the FIN from CLOSE has been ack.-ed), all resets with seq. num.
in window reset the connection. RST 

This is a slight deviation from RFC 5961, which specifies that for all synch.
states only resets with the seq. num. equal to  the expected sequence number, 
should reset the connection. (this is the case for all other synch. states 
other than FIN_WAIT2)
