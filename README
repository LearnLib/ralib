RALib
=========================

RALib is a library for learning register automata.

Installation
-------------------------

RALib uses the [*jConstraints*][1] library as an abstraction layer for interfacing
the solver (*jConstraints* uses plugins for supporting multiple constraint solvers.
For licensing reasons no plugin is included in RALib. In order to run RALib you 
have to install a plugin for at least one constraint solver.

There exists a closed source plugin for Microsoft's [Z3][2]). For obtaining and 
installing *jConstraints-z3*, follow the instructions on the [BitBucket page][1].

Installing RALib is then as simple as just running `mvn clean install` and 
`mvn assembly:assembly` in the RALib directory. 


Using RALib
-------------------------

RALib can be used as a library from Java. The test cases that come with RALib
demonstrate how this can be done. RALib currently also provides two tools
that can be run from the shell. A 'simulator' for inferring RA models from 
simulated systems (automata) and a 'class analyzer' for inferring RA models
of Java classes. Running

`java -ea -jar ../../lib/ralib-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

will show some help and available options to the tools.
